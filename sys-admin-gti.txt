Steps to create a remote repostiory. 
1. Login to github and create a repo
2. cd into the folder that you want to do.
3. git init
4. git commit -m "first commit"
5. git remote add origin https://github.com/some/suff/decided/by/github
6. git push -u origin master


git rm --cached log.txt
this removes a file that has been staged for commit. 
look at the gitignore file. You add a file or folder here to stop it being added to the repo.

When you are trying to merge and get the error:
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
name of file1
name of file2

Then git rm --cached name of file1 will not work. You need to checkout the branch you are tying to merge run the rm --cached command then add the files and commit them. Then you checkout the master branch and git merge other-branch.
